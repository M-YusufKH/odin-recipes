    <h4>A plate of delicious Biryani!</h4>
    <p>In this recipe, you will be taught how to make some authentic Pakistani and Indian Biryani.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oil/Ghee</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Skinless Chicken</li>
        <li>Whole spices</li>
        <li>Garlic + Ginger</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the biryani masala (or use store-bought) and marinate the chicken.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken curry. While it’s cooking over low heat, prepare the rice. </li>
        <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and parboil the rice. Drain and set aside. </li>
        <li>Marinate the chicken in spices and yogurt. This infuses the chicken with noticeable flavor. Ideally, marinate overnight or for at least a couple hours, but I tested and found that it’s still very tasty if you marinate just before making the biryani.</li>
        <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge before you start preparing the biryani. Allowing the chicken to come closer to room temperature helps it cook more evenly and stay tender.</li>
        <li>Lastly, after sautéing the chicken in the hot oil, add water and allow the chicken to simmer gently, covered, over low heat.</li>
        <li>And that's it! You can now enjoy your biryani packed with exquisite flavours and inique flavours... Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
