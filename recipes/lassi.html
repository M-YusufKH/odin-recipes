    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add ingredients in a blender and blend until no longer icy.
         If you would like to keep some of the bits of ice, blend for a shorter time.</li>
        <li>Taste and add sugar for sweetness, yogurt for more tart flavor, ice to make it cooler.</li>
        <li>Pour into two large glasses or 3-4 small. This recipe makes around 4 cups (32 oz), so 2 large lassis or 4 kid-size, though my kids usually demand more than 8 oz.
